Client-server model

The client starts the conversation. It sends a request to the server.
The server sends back a response to the client.

If there is a server and no clients there's no problem.

The client and the server can be in separate computers or in the same one.

They are connected through the internet. It allows them to communicate with each other. Inside the Internet there are
isolated computer connected to each other and divided in groups called networks. If we want to send a message from the
client in one computer to the server in another computer we need an IP address (network interface). If we move to another
computer a new IP address is created.

My IP address at the university is 10.0.45.201
The IP address of this computer is 212.128.253.69
The teacher's IP address is 212.128.253.64

There is a command called Ping that sends a message in order to know if it is connected.
Ping time to 8.8.8.8: 3.71 ms
Ping time to this computer: 0.057 ms (57 us)
Ping time to a computer in the same network: 0.454 ms
Ping time to my mobile phone: 168 ms

URL (identifying a computer interface for humans)
Ping www.google.com : IP: (216.58.211.228)
PING www.urjc.es (212.128.240.50) 56(84) bytes of data.

Port to identify a server inside a computer. To connect to a specific server we need the IP and the port.THIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLETHIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLETHIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE
